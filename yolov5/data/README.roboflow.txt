The dataset includes 404 images.
Tire are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
